1,Priyanka Chatterjee,20 November 2018,4.4 out of 5 stars,Worst product till Date,"within 2 month... Mother board crashed and second time , half black screen half display..It is completely loss to buy such high phone with so much price.. basic infrastructure is bad,I want a replacement for this cell phone. Totally lost confidence on huawai.  If 60k priced phone behaves such a low quality level , its a big matter of concern for the company...Looking forward for some solution."
2,Dinesh Agrawal,30 August 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars,Wrost product,I was purchased this phone on 27 july and fingerprint sensor has suddenly stopped working only in one month...
3,Yash,13 January 2019,1.0 out of 5 stars,"First DSLR camera phone, Love it","- Specifically its night mode pictures are mind boggling, i think no other phone camera can beat it.- 10x Zoom in capacity is great, pictures are very clear, no other phone camera can beat it.- Other like Slow motion, Portraits and other mode are also giving great pictures.- 40mp not support zoom in but it's okey.- Check attached snaps.Leica lense are German made company lenses, Very powerful lenses.I have special purchased this phone for photography and im 100% satisfiedand recommended for photography lovers."
4,Venkatesh S,18 November 2018,1.0 out of 5 stars,A splendid option for photography enthusiasts,"Purchased this during the great Indian sale. The main reason for purchasing this phone was for the camera. And it truly lives up to the expectations. Night time photography is wonderful. AI scene detection is useful in some instances but bothersome in other cases. Greenery mode increases the green hue, cloud mode increases the blue hue of the sky giving some unnatural looking effects. But the AI mode can be dismissed from the screen easily or turned off altogether. Zoom works wonders without compromising on image quality. So, if you are a photography buff, go for it."

8,Amazon Customer,12 November 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent Phone with premium look and capabilities, Great rear and low light camera","This is a very good phone with excellent camera capabilities and photo experience. I worked with almost all features of this phone and this is an ultimate phone to buy /use, especially who has/have great interest for camera. Rear Camera and Lowlight images are too good and as expected. However the selfie camera must be improvised by adding more features as I was more interested for Selfies.. Sound is loud and clear, no noise and battery is lasting for 2- 3 days based on the usage. When people see this phone for the firt time, they feel amazed by its premium look and feel. Overall Best Camera phone with premium looks and feel for this price tag, great technology from Huawei and I am happy to have this phone."

After a lot of research I choose this mobile. Undoubtedly the p20 pro rear camera have a great picture quality????, but the Huawei failed to bring the same picture quality in front camera????.Sound quality is really good i like the bass and treble in Dolby Atmos while connecting type c cable. PS: Dolby Atmos doesn't work with Bluetooth headsets or speaker's.Battery quality: thanks for super fast charging. Battery stands upto 8hrs when we use continuesly. Once the reach 10% Battery started drains quickly to 0% within 30min so we should activate the ultra power saver mode.Pros:Rear camera 4.5/5Sound quality 4/5Display 5/5Performance 5/5Battery 3.5/5Cons:Front camera 2/5Only one stereo speaker.Face id doesn't work in dark room."
